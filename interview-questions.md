# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:I don't remember what that is but I would look through the week 1 syllabus to find the definition.

  Researched answer: In javascript conditional statments are when the code is telling to do a specific action using the word if.

(My apologies for any terrible spelling mistakes I will most likely make)

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a command that you can use in the terminal to instigate an action. Git is a command and github is a online website blog where you can send code from you pc to. 

  Researched answer:Git is a software used for navigating and making changes to a pc's files and folders. Github is an internet hub used via git commands. It is a place for distributing and managing code publically.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: I don't remember but I would check through the Javascript section of the syllabus to find the answer.

  Researched answer: A conditional statment will evaluate a boolean value.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:I can't remember the definitions of either of these words but I would return to the first part of the javascript lecture to find out what these each mean.

  Researched answer: An index represents each specific location of a character in a string. A value is an element in an array where as an index is a specific location in a string.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: I do not remember what an interation is but I would first start by looking through the week 1 of the syllabus to find the meaning

  Researched answer: Iteration is used to obtain more specific answers by repeating the computational procedure to the answer of a question agin or multiple times.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is when 2 or more people are working on the same code together. Usually 1 person is the "Driver" and 1 or more persons are the "Navigator". The driver usually shares their screen and does the actual coding / typing. The Navigator's dictate and advise the driver where to go and what to type.

  Researched answer: Because each person has differnt strenghts and weakness' paired programming can be a better way to solve problems than to otherwise program solo. Programming is a complicated and difficult task and having more than a single person work on a project can lead to quicker and better solutions. It requires a lot of communication with 1 person primarly using the keyboard for tryping code the navigator giving them instructions on what to do. It is also improtant to remember to frequently switch rolls thorughout a session and take breaks. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A subset of methods that are built in to argue a function that act on arrays

2. Jest: Created by facebook, jest is a way to take a javascript codebase and test a framework that checks for correctness.

3. Objects: The cross section of static information and methods, objects are a type of data that collect key value pairs.

4. Method: A method is when a function belongs to an object

5. Classes: Classes are the foundation for objects in a similar way to functions they can be reusable and costamizable.
